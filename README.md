I'm a 19-year-old programming student currently studying at Ecole 42

Through my studies, at 42 I have been learning C and am well on my way to moving on to C++. I have basic experience in Cisco Networking from my time studying at the Open University and from personal experience running a home lab. I mainly have experience in Windows and Linux with basic MacOS experience.

In my free time, I like to work on side projects, run and manage personal servers (including but not limited to game servers for my friends), play video games (my all-time favorite being Team Fortress 2), and ride my motorcycle (a BMW f850 gs).
